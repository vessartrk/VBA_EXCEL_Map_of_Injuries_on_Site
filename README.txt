Hello everyone!

- I have developed this custom program to support our Health & Safety department
	Traditional charts and graphs proved ineffective, so we explored a more visually engaging approach

- The solution was an interactive map, where users can click on individual items to view detailed information in a separate window
	This provides immediate insights by clearly distinguishing injury types and observations across each department

- User can select Year / month and then executes individually accordingly to category:
	- INJURIES - month / year / clear data
	- OBSERVATIONS - month / year / clear data

The administrator inputs the data and can present it either by sending it as a report via email or by presenting it live in a team meeting,
	as execution takes couple of seconds

This was my first large-scale VBA project, and it took several months to complete as part of my role
	Through this project, I learned a great deal about VBA—particularly how to handle issues, errors, and its limitations

You are welcome to use this program freely, even if it may not be directly useful due to its location-specific nature
	
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me
